## The challenge

Please develop the machine in ruby.

- Design a vending machine in code. 
- The vending machine, once a product is selected and the appropriate amount of money (coins) is inserted, should return that product. 
- It should also return change (coins) if too much money is provided or ask for more money (coins) if there is not enough. 
- Keep in mind that you need to manage the scenario where the item is out of stock or the machine does not have enough change to return to the customer. 
- 25c 50c 1$ 2$ 5$
